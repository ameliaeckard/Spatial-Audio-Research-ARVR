# Technical Specifications

## System Architecture

### Overview
The application uses a modular architecture separating concerns across managers, views, and models following MVVM patterns adapted for SwiftUI and visionOS.

## Core Components

### 1. Object Recognition System

**ObjectRecognitionManager.swift**

Responsibilities:
- Real-time object detection using ARKit scene understanding
- Object classification and labeling
- Distance estimation
- Tracking detected objects across frames

Technologies:
- ARKit Scene Reconstruction
- Vision framework for object classification

Key Methods:
```swift
func startObjectDetection()
func processARFrame(_ frame: ARFrame)
func identifyObjects(in scene: ARScene) -> [DetectedObject]
