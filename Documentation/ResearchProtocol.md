## Study Title
Evaluating Spatial Audio Cues for Object Recognition Using Apple Vision Pro: An Assistive Technology Study for Visually Impaired Users

---

## Research Questions

### Primary Research Question
How do spatial audio cues using the Apple Vision Pro affect real-world object recognition accuracy and response time for visually impaired users?

### Secondary Research Questions
1. What types of spatial audio cues are most effective for different object categories?
2. How does user performance with spatial audio compare to traditional assistive methods?
3. What is the learning curve for effectively using spatial audio object recognition?
4. How does environmental complexity affect system performance?
